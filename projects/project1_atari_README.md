# Project 1: Atari Pong with Deep RL

Train an agent to play Atari Pong using deep reinforcement learning.

---

## 🎮 Overview

**Pong** is a classic Atari game where you control a paddle to bounce a ball past your opponent. It's a great testbed for visual RL because:
- State is raw pixels (84x84 grayscale images)
- Actions are simple (up, down, stay)
- Fast training (~30 min for decent performance)
- Clear progress visualization

**Goal:** Beat the built-in AI opponent consistently

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

The baseline uses **stable-baselines3** with a CNN policy trained on preprocessed frames.

### Requirements
```bash
pip install stable-baselines3[extra] gymnasium[atari,accept-rom-license]
```

### Run Baseline (5 minutes)
Open `project1_atari_pong.ipynb` and run all cells. This will:
1. Load Pong environment with frame preprocessing
2. Train a PPO agent for 100k steps (~5 min)
3. Evaluate and visualize the trained agent

**Expected result:** Agent wins ~50-70% of games after 100k steps.

## 📊 Baseline Performance

| Timesteps | Win Rate | Training Time |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| 50k | 20-40% | ~2 min |
| 100k | 50-70% | ~5 min |
| 500k | 80-95% | ~25 min |
| 1M | 95-100% | ~50 min |

## 💡 Ideas to Improve

### 1. **Train Longer**
- Baseline: 100k steps
- Try: 500k or 1M steps
- Impact: Significantly better performance

### 2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
```python
# Try different learning rates
learning_rate = [1e-4, 3e-4, 1e-3]

# Adjust frame stack
n_stack = [2, 4, 8]  # How many frames to stack

# Modify network architecture
policy_kwargs = dict(
    net_arch=[dict(pi=[128, 128], vf=[128, 128])]  # Bigger network
)
```

### 3. **Algorithm Comparison**
- Try DQN (value-based) vs PPO (policy-based)
- Compare A2C (simple) vs PPO (robust)
- Use different CNN architectures

### 4. **Frame Preprocessing**
- Current: 84x84 grayscale, 4-frame stack
- Try: Different resolutions (64x64, 96x96)
- Experiment: Skip more frames for faster training

### 5. **Reward Shaping**
- Default: +1 for scoring, -1 for opponent scoring
- Try: Add intermediate rewards (e.g., hitting ball)
- Caution: Can help but might create shortcuts

## 🔬 Advanced Extensions

### 1. **Multi-Game Transfer**
Train on multiple Atari games and see if skills transfer:
- Pong → Breakout (both paddle games)
- Compare single-task vs multi-task

### 2. **Curiosity-Driven Exploration**
Add intrinsic motivation to explore novel states:
```python
# Use RND (Random Network Distillation) or ICM
from stable_baselines3.common.torch_layers import BaseFeaturesExtractor
# Implement curiosity bonus
```

### 3. **Self-Play**
Instead of fixed opponent, train two agents against each other:
- Leads to more diverse strategies
- Can discover novel tactics
- Requires custom environment wrapper

### 4. **Visual Attention Analysis**
Understand what the agent is "looking at":
- Use Grad-CAM or saliency maps
- Visualize which pixels are important
- Debug why agent fails in certain situations

### 5. **Distributional RL**
Use distributional value functions (C51, QR-DQN):
- Better uncertainty estimation
- Can handle stochastic rewards
- More sample efficient

### 6. **Human-Level Performance Analysis**
- Measure: frames to reach 90% win rate
- Compare: different algorithms on sample efficiency
- Benchmark: your agent vs human players

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Track these to measure progress:
- **Win rate** vs built-in AI
- **Average episode reward** (-21 to +21)
- **Training time** to reach 90% wins
- **Sample efficiency** (wins per 100k steps)
- **Robustness** (performance across 5 random seeds)

- Document results (plots, win rate)
- Brief analysis (what worked, what didn't)

**Standard** (improvements):
- Try 2-3 hyperparameter configurations
- Compare 2 algorithms (e.g., PPO vs DQN)
- Analyze learning curves and failure cases

**Advanced** (extensions):
- Implement 1-2 advanced ideas
- Detailed comparison and analysis
- Novel insight or technique

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Agent doesn't improve:**
- Train longer (500k steps minimum)
- Check frame preprocessing is working
- Verify rewards are being received

**Training is too slow:**
- Use GPU if available
- Reduce evaluation frequency
- Decrease frame size (84x84 → 64x64)

**Unstable training:**
- Lower learning rate (1e-4)
- Increase batch size
- Use PPO instead of DQN

Good luck! 🚀 Pong is a great starting point for visual RL.
